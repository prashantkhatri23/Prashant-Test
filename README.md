# CS753 -  Hacker Role - Imputer

## Motivation

- Fully autoregressive end-to-end ASR methods like RNN-Transducer are slow as they require a total of N steps.
- Non-autoregressive methods like CTC are faster and require only a single step, but their assumption of conditional independence degrades performance.
- Imputer aim to reduce inference time without significantly impacting model performance by utilizing certain characteristics of the ASR task, such as its monotonic alignment. As a result it is able to perform inference in a constant number of steps independent of the sequece length.

## Method Overview

### Before Training

1. Train a Expert CTC Model.
2. Use this expert model to generate the best alignment for each example in the training set.

### Taining

1. For each training example $(x, y)$, fetch the alignment a generated by the expert model.
2. Use a masking policy to get a masked out alignment ã.
3. Feed the superposition of $ã$ and $x$ to the Imputer, and get the output distribution for posterior alignment.
4. Compute CTC loss, after freezing the unmasked tokens at their positions.
